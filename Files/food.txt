    ingredients:
      1 1/2 lbs ground beef (ground shoulder roast is good)
      1 slice bread (broken or chopped finely)
      1 egg
      1 small vidalia onions or 1 small type sweet onion, finely chopped
      1 teaspoon table salt
      1/4 teaspoon black pepper
      4 tablespoons ketchup
      1/2-2/3 cup whole milk or 1/2-2/3 cup half-and-half
      4 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
      2 -4 tablespoons dark brown sugar, packed firm (to taste)
      1/2 cup ketchup

    recipe instructions:
      1 Meatloaf: Combine meat loaf ingredients and place into a loaf baking dish. 2 Smooth out top. 3 Sauce: Combine sauce ingredients and pour on top and sides of meatloaf. 4 Bake at 350°F about 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes or until done. 5 ENJOY! 6 *The addition of 1 or 2 teaspoons of Kitchen Bouquet® makes this recipe very good. 7 **Recipe should be"plump" from the addition of the milk or Half & Half. 8 It should NOT be runny. 9 ***A second batch of sauce served hot is good to serve with the meatloaf. 10 Nita's Note: I note that some of you are using game meat such as deer -- Deer is a very DRY meat. It is wise to HAVE some fat added to the deer -- especially to ground deer. Maybe 25 % fat, ( I recommend 1 lb of ground venison, and 1/2 lb of deer sausage for fat content), otherwise your results will be poor. I don't know about some of the other game meat some are using. Please consult and expert. The recipe is delicious as it stands! Enjoy! Nita Holleman.

    description:I love tasting different cornbread recipes, and I have to admit, I think this is the best that I've ever tasted. Usually I have to put tons of butter on it, because it's so dry and just doesn't have much taste to it, but this recipe is very moist, and you can eat it alone, it's got a great sweet taste to it. Try it...and let me know what you think. Thanks to Betty Crockers Big Red Cookbook for this great recipe.

    recipe instructions:
      1 Preheat oven to 225 degrees. 2 Season your ribs with Dale's marinade, your favorite rib rub, grill seasoning, or simply salt and pepper. 3 Place ribs, meat side down, in baking dishes. 4 Cover the baking dishes with aluminum foil and place in the oven. 5 If you are using small baby back ribs, take out after 3.5 hours. If you are using regular baby back or St. Louis style ribs, then take out after 4 hours. 6 Drain off the drippings. Flip the ribs over using two spatulas (and an extra set of hands if you have them) so the meat side is up. Be careful, as they may be so tender they fall apart. 7 Put a layer of BBQ sauce on the ribs and return to the oven uncovered for an additional 20-30 minutes. 8 Remove from oven and serve them up with a side of potato salad and some baked beans.

    description:I almost didn't want to share this ribs recipe because this is one of the dishes that I make that keep my sons coming back home! These can be done with baby back or regular pork ribs. I have also made split chickens this way. The ribs are tender, moist and just slide off of the bone. I know that your family will love them just as much as my family does. I noticed that some are unable to find hickory smoked salt. You can use smoked paprika or just brush the ribs with liquid smoke before applying the rub. The smoke flavor is nice because it helps give the ribs a cooked-on-the-grill flavor. Also, the easiest way to remove the membrane is to work a spoon, or I use the tips of my kitchen shears, into the bottom center of the membrane, work it back and forth to form a "pocket," then I slide my thumbs in and work the membrane off from the center outward to the ends.
