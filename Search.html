                <option lable="1"value="Absolutely delicious meatloaf and sauce! Those who claim they don't believe there can be such a thing as a great meatloaf will love this. Based on a meatloaf given to me by a dear friend, Virginia Strehl, Memphis, and Leesburg, Fla. Nita Holleman, 2000">
                <option lable="2"value="My mother-in-law gave me this recipe years ago and it is the one I make the most. Super easy. Halve the recipe to cover one bag of prepared slaw vegetables. Prep time does not include chill time.">
                <option lable="3"value="I love tasting different cornbread recipes, and I have to admit, I think this is the best that I've ever tasted. Usually I have to put tons of butter on it, because it's so dry and just doesn't have much taste to it, but this recipe is very moist, and you can eat it alone, it's got a great sweet taste to it. Try it...and let me know what you think. Thanks to Betty Crockers Big Red Cookbook for this great recipe.">
                <option lable="4"value="This makes a delicious brownie for one in about a minute. I used a 1500 watt microwave. 60 seconds makes a molten center brownie. 75 seconds make a uniformly done brownie. Careful not to overcook.">
                <option lable="5"value="This is a family favorite that I have been making for years. It's the most requested oatmeal cookie recipe I've ever made. I found it somewhere years ago, but have lost the source. The secret is soaking the raisins which makes all the difference.">
                <option lable="6"value="This is truly the ONLY rib recipe you will ever need. Ribs simply don't get any better than this! You'll need a fork and knife to eat these, as they will FALL OFF THE BONE. . .tastier than you can imagine. And they couldn't be easier, just throw them in the oven and you are good to go. . .just make sure you have some of your favorite BBQ sauce on hand!">
                <option lable="7"value="This recipe is from Womack House, a long ago country kitchen in Fulshear, TX. It tastes like summer!">
                <option lable="8"value="To me Fannie Farmer's recipe is the only real Macaroni & Cheese. It's from my 1946 edition of Fannie Farmer's Boston Cooking School Cookbook. With time on it's side - this recipe is hands down the best for traditional, homemade baked macaroni & cheese - comfort food. Please Note: If you use CHEAP CHEESE you will end up with a BLAND and FLAVORLESS DISH!">
                <option lable="9"value="I almost didn't want to share this ribs recipe because this is one of the dishes that I make that keep my sons coming back home! These can be done with baby back or regular pork ribs. I have also made split chickens this way. The ribs are tender, moist and just slide off of the bone. I know that your family will love them just as much as my family does. I noticed that some are unable to find hickory smoked salt. You can use smoked paprika or just brush the ribs with liquid smoke before applying the rub. The smoke flavor is nice because it helps give the ribs a cooked-on-the-grill flavor. Also, the easiest way to remove the membrane is to work a spoon, or I use the tips of my kitchen shears, into the bottom center of the membrane, work it back and forth to form a pocket, then I slide my thumbs in and work the membrane off from the center outward to the ends.">
                <option lable="10"value="This recipe was my Mother's and she taught me to make them. My sons and their families always request these eggs for all family get-together dinners.">
                
                <option lable="11"value="A spicy chicken and pesto pasta dish that's easy to adjust to any heat level. I created it after eating a similar dish at a Santa Monica restaurant, and it's one of my favorites. Serve with additional grated Parmesan, if desired. As an option, it's delicious with creamy goat cheese stirred in at the end.">
